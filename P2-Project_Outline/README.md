## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The website media-review application will allow someone to create a user account. Users will be able to upload a book that they have read with givin information such as its name, author and ISBN number. Once a user adds a book, it will be saved and showed in a view all list. Users will also be able to search for a specific novel as well. Once a user locates a book, they can then rate the book on a 1-5 scale. Users will be able to see the average rating for each book. We all could occasionally use a good book to read, so having an available rating scale and possible suggestions will be helpful. 
### Features
User Login: Users will be able to create an account and login
Add a Book: Users can add a book to the website that they have read with the given information (ISBN, TITLE, AUTHOR).
Search: Users can search for a specific book through the nav bar. 
Review and Update: Users can Rate, update and delete books from the view.
### Technologies
Java
Springboot
Angular
MongoDB
Postman
### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to use a noSQL database rather than the mySQL we are familiar with. I will have to learn the postman method so I can track post requests without the UI available. One specific challenge, will be allowing user login and authentication.

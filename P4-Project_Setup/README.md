### Project Discription

Overview:
The media-review application will first allow someone to create a user account. Users will be able to upload a book that they have read with given information such as its name, author and ISBN number. Once a user adds a book, it will be saved and showed in a view all list. The Book will also be storred with a date/time added and a date/time read. Users will also be able to search for a specific novel as well. Once a user locates a book, they can then rate the book on a 1-5 scale. Users will be able to see the average rating for each book. We all could occasionally use a good book to read, so having an available rating scale and possible suggestions will be helpful.
